That is the project must implement actions that are additional to what would occur compared to the baseline.","The proposed project contributes to the goals of the UN Sustainable Development Goals; such as Goal 1: No Poverty, Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, Goal 13: Climate Action and the Goal 15: Life on Land. 
The project activities cover the UN Global Goals which aims to end Poverty and protect the planet by 2030. In the project activity, the project owner makes sure that all of the work in the project site helps to achieve the abovementioned goals. Therefore all kinds of hand works and taking care of the almonds trees are done by the local people, especially the people from the village Aktepe. In this way, the villagers’ extra income will raise and support their families’ income. 
The proposed project  also includes the Goal 8 “Decent Work and Economic Growth” which promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth as long as the project activities at the project site bear the village Aktepe is performed as planned. The local people will be able to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men who come from the Village Aktepe. The project owner is respectful for applying the promoting jobs for the local people by enterprising, rights at work at the project site. The project is aiming to extend social protection and promote social dialogue and not to hire the child work force at all.  
The Proposed Project is on the focus of the Goal 13: Climate action: The Project Owner monitors the impacts of climate change on nature at the Village Aktepe and tries to do the best in order to conserve the existing structure and restoration of the ecosystem at the project site so that the plantation of the almond trees can adopt it and mitigate the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It is clear that the population of the Village Aktepe is decreasing year by year due to the climate change which threatens people’s lives and the livelihoods, the survival of the species and integrity of ecosystem in the project site. The project owner has already invested in the plantation of almond trees and the restoration of the area structure. In this way, the project owner will provide sustainable management of nature which can provide around 476 847 tons of carbon dioxide emissions mitigation in 30 years needed by 2048.    
The proposed project is surely after the UN Goals 15: Life on Land. The contribution of the project to Goal 15 proves that it protects, restore  the degraded project site soil. It promotes sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainable management of the Almond Orchard Agroforestry, and combat the desertification, and halt biodiversity loss. The project activities ensure all species at the project site including the newly planted almond trees survive healthily and viable population of the 55 thousand trees. The project takes care of the fact that it conserves and restore ecosystem and habitat, within the regulation of the Turkish Government targets by 2050.

In the project activity, the project owner makes sure that all of the work in the project site helps to achieve the abovementioned goals. Therefore all kinds of hand works and taking care of the almonds trees are done by the local people, especially the people from the village Aktepe. In this way, the villagers’ extra income will raise and support their families’ income. , The proposed project  also includes the Goal 8 “Decent Work and Economic Growth” which promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth as long as the project activities at the project site bear the village Aktepe is performed as planned. The local people will be able to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men who come from the Village Aktepe. The project owner is respectful for applying the promoting jobs for the local people by enterprising, rights at work at the project site. The project is aiming to extend social protection and promote social dialogue and not to hire the child work force at all.  , The Proposed Project is on the focus of the Goal 13: Climate action: The Project Owner monitors the impacts of climate change on nature at the Village Aktepe and tries to do the best in order to conserve the existing structure and restoration of the ecosystem at the project site so that the plantation of the almond trees can adopt it and mitigate the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It is clear that the population of the Village Aktepe is decreasing year by year due to the climate change which threatens people’s lives and the livelihoods, the survival of the species and integrity of ecosystem in the project site. The project owner has already invested in the plantation of almond trees and the restoration of the area structure. In this way, the project owner will provide sustainable management of nature which can provide around 476 847 tons of carbon dioxide emissions mitigation in 30 years needed by 2051.    , The proposed project is surely after the UN Goals 15: Life on Land. The contribution of the project to Goal 15 proves that it protects, restore  the degraded project site soil. It promotes sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainable management of the Almond Orchard Agroforestry, and combat the desertification, and halt biodiversity loss. The project activities ensure all species at the project site including the newly planted almond trees survive healthily and viable population of the 55 thousand trees.

By supplying renewable energy generated at the plant to the national grid, the proposed Project will contribute to increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and the proportion of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology., The demand for food and electric energy is rapidly increasing in Turkey for various reasons, such as industrialization, urbanization, economic development, and population growth. The country's external dependence on agricultural products has intensified because the increasing demand cannot be met by a decreasing domestic agricultural production capacity which is due to several reasons, such as shrinkage of agricultural land, increasing migration to urban spaces from rural areas where agricultural production is densely located, and dramatic increase in the cost of inputs for agricultural production. Therewithal, Turkey, which cannot meet its increasing electricity demand due to the deprivation of conventional resources used to generate energy, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, has also become foreign-dependent on energy. Through its implementation, the proposed project activity will contribute to reducing Turkey's foreign dependency by generating renewable energy out of municipal wastes. In addition, as an biomass fueled renewable energy technology implementation, the proposed project activity will achieve higher levels of economic productivity; hence, increasing the annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person. Moreover, it will increase the region's employment capacity while decreasing the unemployment rate., The proposed project activity will reduce GHG emissions by capturing and utilizing methane, one of the most potent GHGs triggering climate change.

Over the Project’s lifetime, the CO2 removals from the atmosphere total 27,910 tCO2e., The project aims to reduce marine pollution by improving water quality through the natural biofilter action of mangroves. These mangroves trap sediments, nutrients, and pollutants with their dense root systems, effectively reducing marine debris and nutrient pollution. While the exact quantity of pollution reduction is not quantified at this initial stage of plantation, the overall water quality is expected to improve over the project's lifetime by reducing runoff and filtering pollutants., The project aims to increase forest area as a proportion of total land area, specifically through the stabilization of coastlines and the prevention of erosion by mangroves. These mangroves not only reduce storm surge impacts but also conserve adjacent terrestrial ecosystems and maintain both terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity.

We know that with increased tree cover in urban areas, the wind has calmed down in many places. With increased shelter, people's outdoor activities increase, as the utilization of forests for various outdoor activities has greatly increased as they grow taller. Paths of various types are laid out in the forests where people walk, jog, run and ride horses. When the snow comes in the winter, people take out their cross-country skis and increasingly special paths are laid for mountain bikes. Volleyball and beach volleyball courts are set up, playground equipment, puzzles, mini golf and more. The forest is a place for rehabilitation of people after physical or mental illness or mishap. It is also an ideal classroom for students of all ages in different subjects. The forest thus creates various opportunities for innovation in various sectors, for example tourism, as well as traditional jobs related to the forest's cultivation, care, and use of wood. Numerous studies show that simply by staying in the forest, breathing in the forest air, finding the scent and tranquility in the forest, we can remedy various ailments of soul and body. There are almost limitless opportunities in public health. Increased forest cover therefore increases general well-being and can contribute to increased optimism of people and satisfaction with their living conditions., Various opportunities are created by forestry, including an increase in jobs. Seedlings need to be produced, planted, cared for in the forest, and felled and replanted. All of this requires people, despite ever increasing mechanization. In addition to increased land value, there are opportunities in timber processing and utilization of forests as a food source (mushrooms, berries, etc.) from which value can be created. This creates an ideal opportunity for people to set up small production companies that create value from pure natural resources., The government's policy is for Iceland to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, and an ambitious action plan has been presented in this regard. The most important thing is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can and sequester the rest. This is where forestry comes in, as various studies show that carbon sequestration through forestry gives very good results. Based on 30 years of research, black cottonwood (a poplar) captures the most tCO2e (carbon equivalents) of the tree species that are being worked with in carbon sequestration projects and downy birch captures the least. The total number of carbon units that are captured in the 50 years that are being looked at, therefore, depends considerably on the species that are selected and considered suitable for planting in the area. Suitability is based on site quality of the land to be afforested and location, i.e., elevation, distance from the coast, slope, and soil depth.  , The forest also increases the number of species of birds, plants, fungi, and small animals in the wild. Increased diversity improves both nature and human life. Higher forest cover also improves resilience with respect to disturbance events, some of which are linked to climate change. In the countryside, forests support other land use sectors by providing shelter for people, livestock, and arable land, increasing vegetation and more., SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land","Refstaðir",NA,"Gert ráð fyrir að alaskaösp sé ræktuð á 60 ha, sitkagreni á 75 ha, stafafura á 40 ha og birki á 5 ha.

"Vík í Mýrdal","ce5bab1b-0fb7-4a31-b507-e26f6184be92","176","","In Iceland, the shelter provided by the forest is likely to come first to mind. We know that with increased tree cover in urban areas, the wind has calmed down in many places. With increased shelter, people's outdoor activities increase, as the utilization of forests for various outdoor activities has greatly increased as they grow taller. Paths of various types are laid out in the forests where people walk, jog, run and ride horses. When the snow comes in the winter, people take out their cross-country skis and increasingly special paths are laid for mountain bikes. Volleyball and beach volleyball courts are set up, playground equipment, puzzles, mini golf and more. The forest is a place for rehabilitation of people after physical or mental illness or mishap. It is also an ideal classroom for students of all ages in different subjects. The forest thus creates various opportunities for innovation in various sectors, for example tourism, as well as traditional jobs related to the forest's cultivation, care, and use of wood. Numerous studies show that simply by staying in the forest, breathing in the forest air, finding the scent and tranquility in the forest, we can remedy various ailments of soul and body. There are almost limitless opportunities in public health. Increased forest cover therefore increases general well-being and can contribute to increased optimism of people and satisfaction with their living conditions., Various opportunities are created by forestry, including an increase in jobs. Seedlings need to be produced, planted, cared for in the forest, and felled and replanted. All of this requires people, despite ever increasing mechanization. In addition to increased land value, there are opportunities in timber processing and utilization of forests as a food source (mushrooms, berries, etc.) from which value can be created. This creates an ideal opportunity for people to set up small production companies that create value from pure natural resources., The government's policy is for Iceland to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, and an ambitious action plan has been presented in this regard. The most important thing is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can and sequester the rest. This is where forestry comes in, as various studies show that carbon sequestration through forestry gives very good results.  Based on 30 years of research, black cottonwood (a poplar) captures the most tCO2e (carbon equivalents) of the tree species that are being worked with in carbon sequestration projects and downy birch captures the least. The total number of carbon units that are captured in the 50 years that are being looked at, therefore, depends considerably on the species that are selected and considered suitable for planting in the area. Suitability is based on site quality of the land to be afforested and location, i.e., elevation, distance from the coast, slope, and soil depth.  , The forest also increases the number of species of birds, plants, fungi, and small animals in the wild. Increased diversity improves both nature and human life. Higher forest cover also improves resilience with respect to disturbance events, some of which are linked to climate change. In the countryside, forests support other land use sectors by providing shelter for people, livestock, and arable land, increasing vegetation and more., SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land","Heiðardalur, Mýrdalshreppur",NA,"A carbon sequestration project in Heiðardalur, Mýrdalshreppur, based on a total afforestation land area of 100 ha and a given species selection, 50 ha of black cottonwood, 40 ha of Sitka spruce, 5 ha of lodgepole pine and 5 ha of downy birch are expected to be planted over 5 years.

We know that with increased tree cover in urban areas, the wind has calmed down in many places. With increased shelter, people's outdoor activities increase, as the utilization of forests for various outdoor activities has greatly increased as they grow taller. Paths of various types are laid out in the forests where people walk, jog, run and ride horses. When the snow comes in the winter, people take out their cross-country skis and increasingly special paths are laid for mountain bikes. Volleyball and beach volleyball courts are set up, playground equipment, puzzles, mini golf and more. The forest is a place for rehabilitation of people after physical or mental illness or mishap. It is also an ideal classroom for students of all ages in different subjects. The forest thus creates various opportunities for innovation in various sectors, for example tourism, as well as traditional jobs related to the forest's cultivation, care, and use of wood. Numerous studies show that simply by staying in the forest, breathing in the forest air, finding the scent and tranquility in the forest, we can remedy various ailments of soul and body. There are almost limitless opportunities in public health. Increased forest cover therefore increases general well-being and can contribute to increased optimism of people and satisfaction with their living conditions., Various opportunities are created by forestry, including an increase in jobs. Seedlings need to be produced, planted, cared for in the forest, and felled and replanted. All of this requires people, despite ever increasing mechanization. In addition to increased land value, there are opportunities in timber processing and utilization of forests as a food source (mushrooms, berries, etc.) from which value can be created. This creates an ideal opportunity for people to set up small production companies that create value from pure natural resources., The government's policy is for Iceland to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, and an ambitious action plan has been presented in this regard. The most important thing is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can and sequester the rest. This is where forestry comes in, as various studies show that carbon sequestration through forestry gives very good results. Based on 30 years of research, black cottonwood (a poplar) captures the most tCO2e (carbon equivalents) of the tree species that are being worked with in carbon sequestration projects and downy birch captures the least. The total number of carbon units that are captured in the 50 years that are being looked at, therefore, depends considerably on the species that are selected and considered suitable for planting in the area. Suitability is based on site quality of the land to be afforested and location, i.e., elevation, distance from the coast, slope, and soil depth.  , The forest also increases the number of species of birds, plants, fungi, and small animals in the wild. Increased diversity improves both nature and human life. Higher forest cover also improves resilience with respect to disturbance events, some of which are linked to climate change. In the countryside, forests support other land use sectors by providing shelter for people, livestock, and arable land, increasing vegetation and more., SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land","Skógarbrekkur",NA,"Sett er fram sviðsmynd um nýskógrækt á jörðinni Skógarbrekkur í Grímsnesi og Grafningshreppi.

We know that with increased tree cover in urban areas, the wind has calmed down in many places. With increased shelter, people's outdoor activities increase, as the utilization of forests for various outdoor activities has greatly increased as they grow taller. Paths of various types are laid out in the forests where people walk, jog, run and ride horses. When the snow comes in the winter, people take out their cross-country skis and increasingly special paths are laid for mountain bikes. Volleyball and beach volleyball courts are set up, playground equipment, puzzles, mini golf and more. The forest is a place for rehabilitation of people after physical or mental illness or mishap. It is also an ideal classroom for students of all ages in different subjects. The forest thus creates various opportunities for innovation in various sectors, for example tourism, as well as traditional jobs related to the forest's cultivation, care, and use of wood. Numerous studies show that simply by staying in the forest, breathing in the forest air, finding the scent and tranquility in the forest, we can remedy various ailments of soul and body.

Related indicator: 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption, The demand for food and electric energy is rapidly increasing in Turkey for various reasons, such as industrialization, urbanization, economic development, and population growth. The country's external dependence on agricultural products has intensified because the increasing demand cannot be met by a decreasing domestic agricultural production capacity which is due to several reasons, such as shrinkage of agricultural land, increasing migration to urban spaces from rural areas where agricultural production is densely located, and dramatic increase in the cost of inputs for agricultural production. Therewithal, Turkey, which cannot meet its increasing electricity demand due to the deprivation of conventional resources used to generate energy, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, has also become foreign-dependent on energy. Through its implementation, the proposed project activity will contribute to reducing Turkey's foreign dependency by generating renewable energy out of municipal wastes. In addition, as an LFG- based renewable energy technology implementation, the proposed project activity will achieve higher levels of economic productivity; hence, increasing the annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person.

The project provides local communities with practical knowledge and skills regarding sustainable land management practices and biodiversity conservation. In doing so, the project not only augments academic learning but also equips individuals with lifelong skills essential for their continued interaction with the environment. Economic stability and growth brought about by high-impact trees like Shea and Moringa could potentially increase the investment in local education. Furthermore, through the Great Green Wall project, communities acquire knowledge and skills related to sustainable land management and agroforestry, enriching their educational experience., The Great Green Wall project promotes gender equality by creating economic opportunities and empowerment for women. It provides women with income-generating activities, such as the production of plastic-free grow bags from Silk Cotton trees, which bolster their economic independence. This proactive engagement of women fosters social inclusion and equality, contributing significantly to this SDG., The project contributes significantly to clean water availability and sanitation by raising the water table through land restoration. Wells are constructed with care, ensuring their usability and acceptance even by developed world standards. The increased water availability not only improves the immediate living conditions but also supports sustainable agricultural practices in the region., Certain trees in the Great Green Wall project, like the Croton tree, produce oilseeds that can be converted into biodiesel, contributing to the production of affordable and clean energy. This practice reduces dependency on non-renewable energy sources, moving communities towards sustainable energy solutions., The project stimulates economic growth by creating direct employment opportunities in land restoration and indirectly through the establishment of new businesses like honey harvesting and selling tree products. It also aids in addressing the migrant crisis in Europe by providing economic stability in the region, which could reduce the dangerous migration journeys undertaken in search of better living conditions., The Great Green Wall project is a hotbed of innovation and cutting-edge technology in sustainable land management practices. By incorporating a variety of trees, such as Moringa for nutritional purposes, Croton for biofuel production, and Shea for craftwork and cosmetics, the project nurtures green industries that fuel local economic growth. The project also utilizes advanced agroforestry systems to optimally manage these tree species, supporting the development of sustainable infrastructure like solarised wells. Through this constant innovation and commitment to sustainability, the project helps secure investor confidence, ensuring long-term viability and beneficial impact on local communities., By fostering economic stability and creating job opportunities, the project contributes to reducing inequalities within and among communities. It addresses the root causes of economic migration, providing viable alternatives that can improve living standards and decrease socioeconomic disparities., The project promotes the development of sustainable communities through its agroforestry model. By discouraging practices like unnecessary tree felling and encouraging sustainable practices like selling fruit and honey, the initiative builds resilient communities that coexist harmoniously with their environment., The project encourages responsible consumption and production through sustainable land management practices and the creation of eco-friendly products like honey and craft items. It advocates for a balance between human needs and the environment, promoting sustainable use of resources., The Great Green Wall project plays a pivotal role in climate action by restoring degraded lands, enhancing biodiversity, and sequestering carbon. The trees planted not only restore the ecological balance but also combat climate change by reducing the carbon footprint of the region., The project significantly enhances terrestrial biodiversity through the planting of diverse tree species. It actively fights land degradation and desertification, restoring habitats, and providing a sanctuary for diverse flora and fauna., The Great Green Wall project plays a significant role in fostering peace and justice by combating resource scarcity and economic instability, two major roots of conflict. By promoting economic stability, the project directly addresses these causes of unrest. For instance, trees with high SDG impact ratings like the Shea Tree and Moringa provide substantial economic resources through their varied uses, reducing resource insecurity. By creating opportunities for income and empowering communities, particularly through job creation and entrepreneurship, the project ensures more peaceful and just societies. The stable environment fostered by this initiative is integral to strengthening institutions and maintaining peace., The Great Green Wall project exemplifies the power of partnerships in achieving the SDGs.

NA,"7514e974-722e-4d41-9805-29c15be47d32","143","","The Great Green Wall project exemplifies the power of partnerships in achieving the SDGs. By collaborating with local communities, governments, and international organizations, the initiative leverages collective efforts to drive environmental restoration and sustainable development., The Great Green Wall project has a substantial impact on alleviating poverty. This agroforestry initiative improves land health, leading to a rise in the water table and a revitalization of biodiversity, which collectively ensures food security. High-impact trees, notably Shea and Moringa, offer marketable products, creating a sustainable source of income and encouraging local economic growth. New income avenues are also introduced, such as the harvesting of honey from introduced beehives, further enhancing the community's financial stability. Direct job opportunities are created through active land restoration work, with a significant spotlight on empowering women economically. One such example is the innovative use of Silk Cotton trees, where women produce and sell plastic-free grow bags, combining environmental stewardship with economic upliftment. This multi-faceted approach reinforces the project's substantial contribution to poverty reduction., The Great Green Wall project employs a unique agroforestry approach to ensure environmental restoration while providing sustenance and economic benefits to local communities. Agroforestry integrates the planting of trees and the cultivation of crops and fruit-bearing trees, enhancing biodiversity and reinforcing ecosystem resilience. This approach is fundamental in enhancing food security and combating hunger. Fruit-bearing trees, such as Mango and Plantain, with substantial Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) impact ratings, contribute directly to the community's food sources. Concurrently, tree species like the African Locust Bean and Cacao, which have slightly lower SDG impact ratings, provide significant contributions to diversifying the food chain. By fostering improvements in the water table and biodiversity, the project supports sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the communities' vulnerability to food shortages. Therefore, the integration of forestry and agriculture within the agroforestry model plays a pivotal role in combating hunger, and the SDG impact ratings are a testament to the valuable contribution of each species to this goal., The Great Green Wall project contributes significantly to the health and well-being of local communities, beyond just immediate nutritional benefits. Central to this is the Moringa tree, with a high Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) impact rating, celebrated for its immense nutritional value, supplying essential vitamins and minerals that underpin a healthy diet. The Neem tree, despite having a slightly lower SDG impact rating, offers medicinal properties that provide natural remedies for numerous ailments. Additionally, the enhanced quality of life resulting from improved food security, economic stability, and biodiversity, fostered by the project's agroforestry model, positively influences overall health and well-being. Thus, within the broader context of the project, these trees not only augment the local environment's health but also significantly improve the communities' health and well-being, showcasing the Great Green Wall project's comprehensive health benefits., The Great Green Wall project, while primarily focused on environmental restoration, also contributes to quality education. The project provides local communities with practical knowledge and skills regarding sustainable land management practices and biodiversity conservation. In doing so, the project not only augments academic learning but also equips individuals with lifelong skills essential for their continued interaction with the environment. Economic stability and growth brought about by high-impact trees like Shea and Moringa could potentially increase the investment in local education. Furthermore, through the Great Green Wall project, communities acquire knowledge and skills related to sustainable land management and agroforestry, enriching their educational experience., The Great Green Wall project promotes gender equality by creating economic opportunities and empowerment for women. It provides women with income-generating activities, such as the production of plastic-free grow bags from Silk Cotton trees, which bolster their economic independence. This proactive engagement of women fosters social inclusion and equality, contributing significantly to this SDG., The project contributes significantly to clean water availability and sanitation by raising the water table through land restoration. Wells are constructed with care, ensuring their usability and acceptance even by developed world standards. The increased water availability not only improves the immediate living conditions but also supports sustainable agricultural practices in the region., Certain trees in the Great Green Wall project, like the Croton tree, produce oilseeds that can be converted into biodiesel, contributing to the production of affordable and clean energy. This practice reduces dependency on non-renewable energy sources, moving communities towards sustainable energy solutions., The project stimulates economic growth by creating direct employment opportunities in land restoration and indirectly through the establishment of new businesses like honey harvesting and selling tree products. It also aids in addressing the migrant crisis in Europe by providing economic stability in the region, which could reduce the dangerous migration journeys undertaken in search of better living conditions., The Great Green Wall project is a hotbed of innovation and cutting-edge technology in sustainable land management practices. By incorporating a variety of trees, such as Moringa for nutritional purposes, Croton for biofuel production, and Shea for craftwork and cosmetics, the project nurtures green industries that fuel local economic growth. The project also utilizes advanced agroforestry systems to optimally manage these tree species, supporting the development of sustainable infrastructure like solarised wells. Through this constant innovation and commitment to sustainability, the project helps secure investor confidence, ensuring long-term viability and beneficial impact on local communities., By fostering economic stability and creating job opportunities, the project contributes to reducing inequalities within and among communities. It addresses the root causes of economic migration, providing viable alternatives that can improve living standards and decrease socioeconomic disparities., The project promotes the development of sustainable communities through its agroforestry model. By discouraging practices like unnecessary tree felling and encouraging sustainable practices like selling fruit and honey, the initiative builds resilient communities that coexist harmoniously with their environment., The project encourages responsible consumption and production through sustainable land management practices and the creation of eco-friendly products like honey and craft items. It advocates for a balance between human needs and the environment, promoting sustainable use of resources., The Great Green Wall project plays a pivotal role in climate action by restoring degraded lands, enhancing biodiversity, and sequestering carbon. The trees planted not only restore the ecological balance but also combat climate change by reducing the carbon footprint of the region., The project significantly enhances terrestrial biodiversity through the planting of diverse tree species. It actively fights land degradation and desertification, restoring habitats, and providing a sanctuary for diverse flora and fauna., The Great Green Wall project plays a significant role in fostering peace and justice by combating resource scarcity and economic instability, two major roots of conflict. By promoting economic stability, the project directly addresses these causes of unrest. For instance, trees with high SDG impact ratings like the Shea Tree and Moringa provide substantial economic resources through their varied uses, reducing resource insecurity. By creating opportunities for income and empowering communities, particularly through job creation and entrepreneurship, the project ensures more peaceful and just societies. The stable environment fostered by this initiative is integral to strengthening institutions and maintaining peace., SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, SDG 1: End poverty, SDG 2: No Poverty, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land, SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions","GUD One Billion Trees for Africa - Cameroon",NA,"GUD Malta collaborates with Sahel communities in the Great Green Wall, utilizing innovative agroforestry for sustainable land restoration, biodiversity enhancement, and long-term economic benefits.

Mangroves serve as a crucial ecosystem-based approach to disaster risk reduction, offering a natural barrier against the increasing threats of climate change.

Mangroves are known for their unique ability to absorb and store large quantities of carbon dioxide, making them an invaluable asset in the fight against global warming. By restoring mangrove ecosystems, the project directly addresses SDG 13.1, aiming to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards. This is particularly relevant in regions prone to storms and flooding, where mangroves act as natural defense systems. Their dense root systems help in stabilizing shorelines, reducing erosion, and providing a buffer against storm surges and high waves.

In addition to their protective role, mangroves support biodiversity, offering habitat to a myriad of species and contributing to the health of adjacent marine ecosystems. This biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem balance, ensuring the sustainability of fisheries, and supporting livelihoods of local communities, thereby intertwining with other SDGs related to life below water and on land, The mangrove restoration project in Saudi Arabia significantly supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Below Water, by addressing critical objectives to reduce marine pollution, sustain marine and coastal ecosystems, and conserve coastal and marine areas.

Reducing Marine Pollution (SDG 14.1)
Mangroves act as natural filters, capturing pollutants and sediment from runoff, thereby directly contributing to the reduction of marine pollution. By restoring mangrove ecosystems, this initiative works towards SDG 14.1's target to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution from land-based sources by 2025. The restoration efforts improve water quality and decrease the concentrations of harmful pollutants, ensuring cleaner marine environments.

Sustaining Marine and Coastal Ecosystems (SDG 14.2)
Mangrove restoration enhances the sustainability and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems. This aligns with SDG 14.2, aiming for the sustainable management and protection of these ecosystems by strengthening their resilience and supporting restoration efforts for healthier oceans. By adopting ecosystem-based management approaches, the project increases the resilience of coastal and marine ecosystems, contributing to their overall health and productivity.

Conserving Coastal and Marine Areas (SDG 14.5)
Expanding protected mangrove areas contributes to SDG 14.5's goal to conserve at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. Mangroves are vital for biodiversity, providing essential habitats for a wide array of species. Protecting these ecosystems enhances marine biodiversity conservation and supports the maintenance of healthy marine environments.

, The mangrove restoration project in Saudi Arabia profoundly impacts Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, Life on Land, by aligning with its objectives to conserve terrestrial ecosystems, reduce habitat degradation, and integrate ecosystem values into broader development agendas.

Conservation and Sustainable Use of Ecosystems (SDG 15.1)
By expanding mangrove coverage, this initiative directly supports the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems, specifically addressing SDG 15.1. Mangroves, lying at the intersection of land and sea, play a vital role in enhancing terrestrial biodiversity, stabilizing coastlines, and providing habitat for a myriad of species. Their restoration leads to an increase in forest area as a proportion of total land area, contributing to the conservation and enhancement of terrestrial ecosystems.

Reducing Habitat Degradation and Protecting Species (SDG 15.5)
Addressing SDG 15.5, the project takes significant steps to reduce the degradation of natural habitats and halt biodiversity loss. By protecting and restoring mangrove ecosystems, it aids in the conservation of threatened and endangered species. Mangroves are crucial for the survival of diverse wildlife, offering breeding grounds, shelter, and food resources. The initiative thus plays a critical role in preventing the extinction of vulnerable species by safeguarding their habitats.

Integrating Ecosystem and Biodiversity Values (SDG 15.9)
The mangrove restoration project exemplifies the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, aligning with SDG 15.9. It demonstrates the importance of mangroves in coastal protection, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration, urging the inclusion of these values in development and conservation planning. This approach emphasizes the necessity of ecosystem-based management strategies in achieving sustainable development and enhancing community well-being., SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 14: Life Below Water, SDG 15: Life on Land","Dammam DR Sustainable Wetlands and Mangrove Conservation (DD-SWAM)","https://gaia.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/users/39964914-9c14-4b51-86a5-5996716df7d7/files/1715186028211IMG_2680%20Large.jpeg","Saudi Aramco aims to preserve and restore degraded mangroves across Saudi Arabia.

The most important thing is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can and sequester the rest. This is where forestry comes in, as various studies show that carbon sequestration through forestry gives very good results.  Based on 30 years of research, black cottonwood (a poplar) captures the most tCO2e (carbon equivalents) of the tree species that are being worked with in carbon sequestration projects and downy birch captures the least. The total number of carbon units that are captured in the 50 years that are being looked at, therefore, depends considerably on the species that are selected and considered suitable for planting in the area. Suitability is based on site quality of the land to be afforested and location, i.e., elevation, distance from the coast, slope, and soil depth.  , SDG 13: Climate Action","Sveinatunga Sanddalur SP1",NA,"The primary aims of this afforestation project are carbon sequestration and soil protection.

The project is situated in a new forestry area spanning 186 hectares at the mouth of the Sanddalur valley on the Sveinatunga farm in Norðurárdal, West Iceland. It is located 40 kilometers inland and ranges in elevation from 80 to 290 meters above sea level.

The forestry area, known as SP1, encompasses a relatively steep terrain. It consists of a mixture of mossy and gravel areas and relatively fertile ground, making it well suitable for cultivating species such as pine, birch, and larch that require less demanding conditions.

Historically, the area was utilized for agriculture. Extensive sheep grazing over the centuries has caused damage to the land, prompting its designation solely for forestry purposes.

The most important thing is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can and sequester the rest. This is where forestry comes in, as various studies show that carbon sequestration through forestry gives very good results. 
Based on 30 years of research, black cottonwood (a poplar) captures the most tCO2e (carbon equivalents) of the tree species that are being worked with in carbon sequestration projects and downy birch captures the least. The total number of carbon units that are captured in the 50 years that are being looked at, therefore, depends considerably on the species that are selected and considered suitable for planting in the area. Suitability is based on site quality of the land to be afforested and location, i.e., elevation, distance from the coast, slope, and soil depth.  , The forest also increases the number of species of birds, plants, fungi, and small animals in the wild. Increased diversity improves both nature and human life. Higher forest cover also improves resilience with respect to disturbance events, some of which are linked to climate change. In the countryside, forests support other land use sectors by providing shelter for people, livestock, and arable land, increasing vegetation and more., In Iceland, the shelter provided by the forest is likely to come first to mind. We know that with increased tree cover in urban areas, the wind has calmed down in many places. With increased shelter, people's outdoor activities increase, as the utilization of forests for various outdoor activities has greatly increased as they grow taller. Paths of various types are laid out in the forests where people walk, jog, run and ride horses. When the snow comes in the winter, people take out their cross-country skis and increasingly special paths are laid for mountain bikes. Volleyball and beach volleyball courts are set up, playground equipment, puzzles, mini golf and more. The forest is a place for rehabilitation of people after physical or mental illness or mishap. It is also an ideal classroom for students of all ages in different subjects. The forest thus creates various opportunities for innovation in various sectors, for example tourism, as well as traditional jobs related to the forest's cultivation, care, and use of wood. Numerous studies show that simply by staying in the forest, breathing in the forest air, finding the scent and tranquility in the forest, we can remedy various ailments of soul and body. There are almost limitless opportunities in public health. Increased forest cover therefore increases general well-being and can contribute to increased optimism of people and satisfaction with their living conditions., Various opportunities are created by forestry, including an increase in jobs. Seedlings need to be produced, planted, cared for in the forest, and felled and replanted. All of this requires people, despite ever increasing mechanization. In addition to increased land value, there are opportunities in timber processing and utilization of forests as a food source (mushrooms, berries, etc.) from which value can be created. This creates an ideal opportunity for people to set up small production companies that create value from pure natural resources., SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth","Skógálfar, Álfaskeið",NA,"Afforestation on the farm Þóroddsstaðir based on different goals and species composition.

protection, outdoor recreation, timber production and other ecosystem services. The 
project has a wide range of environmental, economic and social benefits. The 100 
hectares that are planned to be planted in this area at Álfabrekka at Þóroddsstaðir in 
Grímsnes in South Iceland are intended to sequester carbon and thus contribute to 
the fight against climate issues. This project also offers increased opportunities for 
landowners to increase income opportunities on the land, e.g. through planting and 
selling certified carbon units. The land has not been cared for very much in recent 
years and quite a while since it was a permanent residence. With afforestation, 
landowners want to cultivate the land even further and build up forestry areas and 
thereby increase the use of the land. This project is therefore important for 
landowners/occupants so that they can continue to generate income from the land. With increased forestry on the land, it can be expected to 
improve the air quality. Numerous side effects are created by afforestation and it is clear 
that opportunities will come. Efforts will be made to make the 
best use of them when they arise (e.g. outdoor activities, food 
production, etc.) Wood will be processed by processing 
companies. It promotes innovation with this first certification of a forestry 
project. There are already forest production plants in close 
proximity to the earth. It is clear that they will benefit from 
increased forestry in the area. There are also opportunities for
small-scale food production (e.g. mushrooms and berries) that 
could be utilized. , The project is a multi-purpose forest with an emphasis on carbon sequestration, soil

The project implements climate actions that are subject to barriers to implementation or accelerates deployment of technology or activities., Financial additionality. Carbon credit revenues are the major or only source of revenues, , , , ","As explained throughout the PDD, CargoBeamer and rail transport have the potential to significantly reduce the emissions of GHG. Carbon savings of up to 85% versus traditional road transport can have a significant impact and actively contribute to combating climate change. We are firm believers that intermodal transport is one of the cheapest and most attainable methods to contribute at scale., A shift from freight transport via diesel trucks to electrical powered traction units on the rail promotes good health and well-being among societies due to significantly lower NOx pollution (up to 80%), noise pollution, and accidents on highways, among others. This claim is supported by the European Handbook on External Costs of Transport (European Commission)., Given existing capacity bottlenecks on European highways (freight transport growth rate significantly surpasses that of highway expansions), it will be crucial that a greater share of freight is transported via rail to facilitate economic growth across the continent. Furthermore, rail transport improves the quality of work for truck drivers, as they are now able to focus more on first and last mile deliveries meaning they can spend more time with families and in their hub country. In light of major truck driver bottlenecks across Europe, this is a key factor that will become crucial for the resilience of the continent’s freight transport industry., CargoBeamer is a highly innovative technology that has won numerous awards. The system allows for the swift horizontal and autonomous shift of freight onto the railway infrastructure. Furthermore, the technology addresses a key technological risk as referenced previously, namely the duration of loading and unloading procedures. With CargoBeamer the time required is reduced to 20 minutes versus 3-4 hours that are needed with traditional crane terminals to date. This allows for higher departure and arrival frequencies for rail transports, meaning that rail can compete more effectively with road. Lastly, due to the transport of up to 36 semi-trailers with one traction unit, CargoBeamer now offers 98% autonomous driving on long distance route for standard semi-trailers., Similar to (SDG 3) Good Health and Well-Being, reduced external costs in the form of accidents, noise and NOx pollution, and traffic will allow countries to develop more sustainable cities and communities in the long-term.

Based on nutritional value, it is the most sustainable food production activity in the world.
Easily integrated within traditional and/or novel foods
Long shelf life at room temp 
Affordable for developing economies , Icelandic Ultra Spirulina (IUS) is a highly nutritious food ingredient, providing Essential Amino Acids, bioavailable Iron and active vitamin B12 - key nutritional factors for health and well being in all ages.
IUS nutritional composition enables FDA/EFSA allowed nutritional and functional claims, at an inclusion rate of <g per serving, Working conditions/requirements at the IUS production facility enable gender equal employment opportunity. The majority of the required education is provided on site, and enables room for professional and personal growth, on a gender-equal basis, Icelandic Ultra Spirulina (IUS) production requires less than 1% of the fresh water used for nutritionally-paired beef production. Therefore, it does not compete on the finite resource of potable water.
IUS production is closed system and waste-free, with no potential contamination of water sources (e.g. fertilizer runoffs). , IUS production is converting clean energy (e.g geothermal) and its waste streams (hot/cold water, waste heat, CO2 emissions) to viable food ingredient, and thus creating additional revenue streams for clean power production, making it more affordable for all., IUS production is a new way of controlled producing food – converting clean energy to sustainable food. It requires a pool of talents with diverse education backgrounds – Operators, technicians, biologists, scientists, mechanics, electricians, QA/QC, food scientists etc. 
It provides decent work environment for all employees and produces a novel crop – IUS, a nutritional, plant-based, substitute to beef, creating a new option for economical growth., IUS production is an innovative technology for food production. It advances agriculture into an industrial, controlled setting. The result – consistent and superior crop quality, year-round., Some of the inequalities within and between countries are resulting from nutritional gaps and nutritional deficiencies. If your body is undernourished, so is your mind. Tiredness and concentration difficulties are only some of the effects of inadequate nutrition.
IUS closes this gap by providing key essential ingredients (e.g essential amino acids, bioavailable iron and active B12), supporting healthy psychological and physiological functions. , One of the key challenges of human settlements is waste management. A significant portion of human waste is nutrition-related (packaging, food waste, expired foods etc.). Icelandic Ultra Spirulina is a zero-waste ingredient (100% nutritional value) with a long shelf life (kept at room temp). 
Another challenge in human settlement is GHG emissions. A portion of these emissions is related to food preparation (e.g. cooking, broiling) and food preservation (refrigeration). Icelandic Ultra Spirulina could be consumed raw, and does not require refrigeration.    , VAXA’s technology platform is the most sustainable way to produce food: Carbon negative, uses less than 1% of the land and water (based on nutritional equivalence) and is pesticide & herbicide free.
It promoted sustainable food consumption as it is zero-waste (100% nutritional value), has a long shelf life at room temp and could be consumed raw., IUS enables nutritional replacement of beef, which is one of the most unsustainable food sources. Since replacing I ton of beef by 1 ton of IUS creates an avoidance of ~100 tons of CO2eq – this is one of the most effective ways to have a noticeable impact on GHG emissions and climate change., Fishing and aquaculture industries have disrupted the sustainability of our oceans, seas and marine resources, due to overfishing and waste management practices. Nevertheless these industries are key providers of essential nutritional ingredients: Essential amino and fatty acids, vitamins & minerals.
IUS presents an alternative nutritional source for these key nutrients, without creating any impact on the marine ecosystem., Since IUS production is >100X more productive, does not require fertile land and uses less than 1% of fresh water (based on nutritional equivalence), it promotes the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, that could otherwise be disrupted by human agricultural activities. , Requiring no fertile land and less than 1% of fresh water  to produce, IUS production disarms potential conflicts associated with control over food production resources (fresh water and fertile land). It promotes nutritional justice for all, while respecting traditional foods and cultures. It promotes effective collaboration between legislative institutions, research institutes, industrial and commercial parties and the public (food consumers).   , The sustainable IUS production & consumption, and the resulting GHG offsets, could only be realized by an international collaboration of global stakeholders: Regulatory/standardizing frameworks, verification and verification bodies, the food production industry and the nutritional choices of the end users – are all essential in this partnership.  , SDG 2: No Poverty, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 14: Life Below Water, SDG 15: Life on Land, SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals","Carbon avoidance through the nutritional replacement of beef by carbon neutral Icelandic Spirulina (blue-green algae) production",NA,"The purpose of the project activity is to produce an edible algal biomass i.e., Spirulina (blue-green algae), which serves as a carbon neutral alternative to Beef in terms of a nutritional parity.

The project implements actions that go beyond statutory requirements., Financial additionality. Carbon credit revenues maintain the projects operations., , , ","The forest also increases the number of species of birds, plants, fungi, and small animals in the wild. Increased diversity improves both nature and human life. Higher forest cover also improves resilience with respect to disturbance events, some of which are linked to climate change. In the countryside, forests support other land use sectors by providing shelter for people, livestock, and arable land, increasing vegetation and more., The government's policy is for Iceland to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, and an ambitious action plan has been presented in this regard. The most important thing is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can and sequester the rest. This is where forestry comes in, as various studies show that carbon sequestration through forestry gives very good results. Based on 30 years of research, black cottonwood (a poplar) captures the most tCO2e (carbon equivalents) of the tree species that are being worked with in carbon sequestration projects and downy birch captures the least. The total number of carbon units that are captured in the 50 years that are being looked at, therefore, depends considerably on the species that are selected and considered suitable for planting in the area. Suitability is based on site quality of the land to be afforested and location, i.e., elevation, distance from the coast, slope, and soil depth.  , In Iceland, the shelter provided by the forest is likely to come first to mind. We know that with increased tree cover in urban areas, the wind has calmed down in many places. With increased shelter, people's outdoor activities increase, as the utilization of forests for various outdoor activities has greatly increased as they grow taller. Paths of various types are laid out in the forests where people walk, jog, run and ride horses. When the snow comes in the winter, people take out their cross-country skis and increasingly special paths are laid for mountain bikes. Volleyball and beach volleyball courts are set up, playground equipment, puzzles, mini golf and more. The forest is a place for rehabilitation of people after physical or mental illness or mishap. It is also an ideal classroom for students of all ages in different subjects. The forest thus creates various opportunities for innovation in various sectors, for example tourism, as well as traditional jobs related to the forest's cultivation, care, and use of wood. Numerous studies show that simply by staying in the forest, breathing in the forest air, finding the scent and tranquility in the forest, we can remedy various ailments of soul and body. There are almost limitless opportunities in public health. Increased forest cover therefore increases general well-being and can contribute to increased optimism of people and satisfaction with their living conditions., Various opportunities are created by forestry, including an increase in jobs. Seedlings need to be produced, planted, cared for in the forest, and felled and replanted. All of this requires people, despite ever increasing mechanization. In addition to increased land value, there are opportunities in timber processing and utilization of forests as a food source (mushrooms, berries, etc.) from which value can be created. This creates an ideal opportunity for people to set up small production companies that create value from pure natural resources., SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss, SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth","Vikrar í landi Skriðufells í Þjórsárdal",NA,"Megin markmið verkefnisins er að binda kolefni í trjám og jarðvegi og ná þannig loftslagsávinningi í samræmi við stefnu stjórnvalda.

The project must implement actions that are beyond requirements stipulated in local legislation or regulations. Projects are statutory additional if their implementation and/or operation is not required by any law, statute, or other regulatory framework, agreements, settlements, or other legally binding mandates requiring implementation and operation or requiring implementation of similar measures that would result in the same mitigations in the host country., Technology, institutional, common practice additionality. The project must implement actions that are subject to barriers of implementation or accelerate deployment of technology or activities and carbon market incentives are essential in overcoming these barriers., Financial additionality II. The project is financially additional if it faces significant financial limitations that revenues from the sale of carbon credits mitigates or are revenues due to the sale of carbon credits are the only source of revenues. When carbon credit revenues are a precondition for the implementation of the project and/or carbon credit revenues are essential in maintaining the project operations and ongoing financial viability post-implementation, then they are considered to be financial additional II., Policy additionality.

When project implementation goes beyond its host country’s climate objectives and lies outside of the scope of its climate action strategy towards its NDCs, it is considered to be policy additional.","To address the goal of ending poverty, our project adopts a multi-faceted approach. We create employment opportunities for the local community-based organizations, engaging them into our seedling nurseries, planting activities and maintenance of the planted trees as part of our community stewardship program.

As part of our social impact and livelihood project, we allocate funds towards microfinance initiatives. These projects aim to support entrepreneurship and small-scale enterprises within the community, contributing to economic growth and poverty alleviation efforts.

By implementing our approach, we actively work towards decreasing the proportion of the population below the international poverty line, promoting development and sustainable livelihoods.
, To address the goal No Poverty, we dedicate a portion of the profits generated from carbon certificate sales to fund social impact projects, aimed at improving water and food security within communities lacking access to these essential services.

Through our social impact initiatives, we prioritize funding for water and food security projects, which include initiatives such as the construction of clean water sources, implementation of sustainable agricultural practices, and establishment of fruit plantations based on community needs, providing sustainable solutions to enhance nutrition within the community. The carbon sequestration estimation does not account for these fruit tree planting projects.

By allocating resources to address these critical needs we strive to increase the proportion of the population living in households with access to basic services., To address the  goal Quality Education, our project directs funding towards schools and orphanages as part of our social impact campaign. By investing in educational institutions, we aim to increase the proportion of children and young people achieving not only the minimum proficiency level in reading and mathematics, but to fund the children finish at least high school.

Through our support, we provide resources and infrastructure to schools and orphanages, ensuring access to quality education for all students regardless of their background. 

We fund educational institutions to promote development and academic success of children and young people.
, To promote Gender equality, our project actively supports initiatives aimed at fostering legal frameworks to promote, enforce, and monitor equality and non-discrimination based on sex. As partners with United Nations Women, we collaborate on programs and advocacy efforts to advance gender equality and empower women and girls.

Through our partnership, we contribute to the development and implementation of legal frameworks that promote gender equality and protect against discrimination based on sex. We advocate for the enforcement of these laws and support monitoring mechanisms to ensure their effectiveness in addressing gender disparities.
, To address the goal Clean Water and Sanitation, our project directs funding towards the construction of water wells and  basic sanitation and hand-washing facilities in schools and orphanages that we fund. By that, we aim to expand access to safe and reliable drinking water sources for communities in need.

By focusing on the construction of water wells, we contribute to improving public health, reducing waterborne diseases, and enhancing overall quality of life for individuals and families.
, To address the goal Affordable and Clean Energy, our project is dedicated to providing communities in need with solar panels. We allocate $100,000 worth of solar panels to underserved areas, increasing access to electricity for households and communities.

Moving forward, our project will continue to prioritize rural electrification as part of our infrastructure funding efforts. By integrating electricity provision into our initiatives for food and water security, education, and skill center facilities, we strive to further advance access to electricity and foster sustainable development in the communities.

Our commitment to expanding access to electricity underscores our dedication to promoting equitable access to essential services and enhancing the well-being of communities., To ensure gender equality and fair treatment of all employees, our project maintains a policy where all employees, regardless of gender or disability status, receive equal pay for work of equal value. This commitment extends across all occupations, age groups, and levels of ability within our workforce.

By upholding this principle, we promote fairness and equity in the workplace, decent work and economic growth for everyone., To address the goal Reduced Inequalities, we allocate funding to support schools, orphanages, and skill centres, aiming to provide education, training, and opportunities for skill development.

We create workspaces to generate employment opportunities, particularly targeting vulnerable groups such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities. By investing in education, training, and employment initiatives, we aim to empower all individuals to improve their earning potential and financial stability, with a focus on females and youths., Bright Future Africa  – Vol.2 (Uganda) is designed to plant 255 Million indigenous trees in deforested public and institutional land. Project aims to restore the natural biodiversity and ensure its long lasting longevity. The project estimate an  offset of  225 Million tCO2 during the crediting period. , Our project is designed to plant 255 million indigenous trees on deforested public and institutional land in Kenya by 2034. By undertaking this initiative, we aim to significantly decrease the proportion of land that is degraded over the total land area.

Through afforestation efforts, we mitigate soil erosion, improve soil fertility, and enhance ecosystem resilience, thereby reversing the degradation process. By restoring deforested land with indigenous trees, we contribute to the restoration of biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources., To address the goal Partnerships for the Goals, our project commits significant financial resources to initiatives aimed at reforestation and community development in Uganda. As for the implementation of the project, we exclusively collaborate with local public-private and civil society groups.

All the funding allocated for social impact and livelihood projects is deployed into civil society groups (community-based organizations) in need.

Through collaborative efforts with local organizations, we leverage our resources to maximize our impact and promote sustainable development in the region, aiming for a lasting positive change and well-being of communities., SDG 1: End poverty, SDG 2: No Poverty, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land, SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals","Bright Future Africa - Vol.2 (Uganda)","https://gaia.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/users/2c7f31af-73f9-470a-90cf-10843a36225c/files/1706029960779-WhatsApp%20Image%202023-10-20%20at%2014.22.51.jpeg","This project is designed to plant 255M indigenous trees on deforested institutional land.

Compared to the baseline scenario the project needs to mitigate climate change. That is the project must implement actions that are additional to what would occur compared to the baseline., Statutory additionality. The project must implement actions that are beyond requirements stipulated in local legislation or regulations. Projects are statutory additional if their implementation and/or operation is not required by any law, statute, or other regulatory framework, agreements, settlements, or other legally binding mandates requiring implementation and operation or requiring implementation of similar measures that would result in the same mitigations in the host country., Technology, institutional, common practice additionality. The project must implement actions that are subject to barriers of implementation or accelerate deployment of technology or activities and carbon market incentives are essential in overcoming these barriers., Financial additionality II. The project is financially additional if it faces significant financial limitations that revenues from the sale of carbon credits mitigates or are revenues due to the sale of carbon credits are the only source of revenues. When carbon credit revenues are a precondition for the implementation of the project and/or carbon credit revenues are essential in maintaining the project operations and ongoing financial viability post-implementation, then they are considered to be financial additional II., Policy additionality. Implementation of actions may lie out of the scope of the host country's Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement and, therefore, not eligible for international transfer mechanism.

A sustainable local food supply also lends well to resilience against economic and environmental shock. , Increased local sustainable levels of marine protein directly reduce hunger and promote good nutrition as food alternatives to fish tend to be lower in nutritional value. Food security is also achieved with the supply chain beginning and ending locally. , Many families rely on small scale fishing. We provide long term sustainable options through biogenic reef creation that allows work, economic stability, income and ocean health. Beautiful reefs will also allow for Eco-tourism., True Blue Carbon based around SeaCave technology is the single most transformative and scalable blue carbon project scheme in the world. It can be scaled to large levels rapidly, requires no maintenance, reduces  land conflicts and Co2 from reduced slash and  burn, reduces fresh water use and is supported by millions globally. The Ocean is a tough place to operate, but Sea Caves are just as tough and last 500 years - sequestering carbon for five centuries. , Sea Caves generate 1,000 Kgs of marine life per year. Sea Caves can convert empty seabed into thriving oasis of life that benefit man and nature alike. Sea Caves are a powerful tool to rapidly improve ocean health and marine abundance as it provides critical habitat for kelp, coral, fish, lobster, abalone, marine mammals and more. , SDG 1: End poverty, SDG 2: No Poverty, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 14: Life Below Water","Sea Cave® True Blue Carbon®, Baja California, Mexico","https://gaia.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/companies/6407fdd7375b8831cf6d91f9/projects/6408c7db0c95b6328326d058/images/projectImage-1683585195275-COLD-WATER_V03.jpg","Sea Cave®  True Blue Carbon® represents a multi-faceted  approach to atmospheric CO2 reduction and Blue Carbon by passively removing CO2 through macroalgae photosynthesis, dramatically reducing carbon emitting process associated with fishing behavior and calculating carbon stored in the reef biomass.

This promotes a much cleaner energy alternative for transport and mobility that has shown to be sustainable and endure though time. Given that the raw materials for the production of said biofuels are waste/residues in their origin, it helps the supply chain by avoiding the consumption of more crops feedstock, making the resulting biofuel an affordable alternative., The installation and continuous improvement into the technologies necessary for the production of biofuels is an incentive to promote innovation in the industry. The growth and updates that this line of work has suffered throughout the time shows to be a motor for the adaptation of the industry. Stepping forward from the first generation biofuel plants that used to produce from crops feedstock, these type of second generation plants work mainly with waste/residues alternatives. These type of biofuel plants are always pushing the technological frontier., Because of the replacement of fossil fuels resulted from the inclusion of sustainable biofuels into de consumption market, the total emissions into the atmosphere are being mitigated. This project originates from the GHG emissions saving resulting from this activity, heading society into a total decarbonization., Biotrading 2007 S.L. produces biofuels from residues originated in alternative processes. These are collected, previously treated to comply with requirements for the inputs of the plant, and the processed in order to achieve the required specification for the final biofuel. The whole supply chain is audited and certified in accordance with sustainability schemes that are in line with the Renewable Energy Directive for the European market of consumption. This guarantees a high level of responsibility into de consumption and classification of these materials in order to comply with scheme requirements., SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production","Substitution of fossil fuels for the use of sustainable biofuels manufactured by Biotrading 2007 S.L ",NA,"Calculation of mitigations of GHG emissions due to the operation of a biofuel plant owned by Biotrading 2007 S.L.

This promotes a much cleaner energy alternative for transport and mobility that has shown to be sustainable and endure though time. Given that the raw materials for the production of said biofuels are waste/residues in their origin, it helps the supply chain by avoiding the consumption of more crops feedstock, making the resulting biofuel an affordable alternative., The installation and continuous improvement into the technologies necessary for the production of biofuels is an incentive to promote innovation in the industry. The growth and updates that this line of work has suffered throughout the time shows to be a motor for the adaptation of the industry. Stepping forward from the first generation biofuel plants that used to produce from crops feedstock, these type of second generation plants work mainly with waste/residues alternatives. These type of biofuel plants are always pushing the technological frontier., Because of the replacement of fossil fuels resulted from the inclusion of sustainable biofuels into de consumption market, the total emissions into the atmosphere are being mitigated. This project originates from the GHG emissions saving resulting from this activity, heading society into a total decarbonization., Green Fuel Extremadura S.A. produces biofuels from residues originated in alternative processes. These are collected, previously treated to comply with requirements for the inputs of the plant, and the processed in order to achieve the required specification for the final biofuel. The whole supply chain is audited and certified in accordance with sustainability schemes that are in line with the Renewable Energy Directive for the European market of consumption. This guarantees a high level of responsibility into de consumption and classification of these materials in order to comply with scheme requirements., SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production","Substitution of fossil fuels for the use of sustainable biofuels manufactured by Green Fuel Extremad",NA,"Calculation of mitigations of GHG emissions due to the operation of a biofuel plant owned by Green Fuel Extremadura S.A.
